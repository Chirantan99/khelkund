          You can participate in the Khelkund Fantasy League by creating your own team. You will be given a budget of $100 million. Using this budget, you can pick your squad of 11 players from all the real life players you know and love, and show off your managerial skills.  Once you create your team, while you concentrate on what’s happening on the pitch, we do the hard work of computing statistics and points on how each player in your team performs as per the scoring rules.
